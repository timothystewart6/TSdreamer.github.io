# Hi

I'm Haotian MA, a doctoral researcher at the [University of Warwick](https://warwick.ac.uk/) focusing on applying data-driven method to accelerate the arrival of a sustainable energy fueled future.

I have a strong academic background in computer engineering, including completion of the [Institute of Data, System and Society, MIT](https://idss.mit.edu/) Summer Program and obtained a master's degree from the [University of Nottingham](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/engineering/). I've finished impactful projects at the [University of Birmingham](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/index.aspx) and the [Global Energy Interconnection Research Institute](https://geiri.eu/).

My bachelor's degree in engineering was obtained from [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/english/) includes honors and multiple awards for energy projects, and finally rewarded as 2019 outstanding graduates of SEU.

With over two years of experience in the energy sector, I've applied machine learning algorithms to optimize energy systems, reduce carbon emissions, and enhance efficiency and security, resulting in contributions to publications and patents in the field.
